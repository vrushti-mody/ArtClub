Right from age 1 , I’ve been scribbling on walls, notebooks, making random sketches here and there, even on people (some who didn’t even volunteer for it) TBH, I was never good at it initially. But there was this urge always to become better with whatever I sketched. Practice got me precision.

## My Education

Like every other Indian kid, I chose engineering first to decide what to do next. Engineering taught me discipline, to handle stress at your worst moment. Around my final year, I figured out that I didn’t want to join an IT company. It was a necessity for me to look out for options outside campus.

I have seen myself getting lost learning new skills in designing which I never did while I was studying engineering. Designing is not my work, it’s my passion. Only few get to work on what they really like and I’m happy to be one amongst them.

I do have plans about doing my masters in art but as of now , I’m still learning new methods and techniques in this field. At the end of the day, my art should make people happy.
