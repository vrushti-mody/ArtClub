I jumped the fence to the other side (The other side)

My whole world was electrified (Electrified)

Now I'm no longer afraid

It's Independence Day (Independence Day)

I'll never be that girl again, no oh oh

I'll never be that girl again, no oh oh

My innocence is wearing thin

But my heart is growing strong

So call me, call me, call me

Miss movin' on
