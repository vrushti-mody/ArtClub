Hi! I had been working on a series of paintings.The series consist of four paintings based on discrete adventurous sports. These paintings have inspired me (I hope it inspires you too) to follow my passion!

# Painting 3 - Upside Down

### Theme : THE BUCKET LIST 

☑️ Follow your dreams

The title speaks it all ! This painting symbolizes the phrase 'Turning your world upside down'.Taking risks , being dedicated , is what makes you stand out from the crowd. To be successful, to achieve what you crave for, is just one step away when you ignite the fire in yourself to never give up.

EVERYDAY IS AN ADVENTURE WHEN YOU FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS .
