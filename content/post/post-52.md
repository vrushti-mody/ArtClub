So I'm just waiting on fate to come.

Wrap around me

Think about all the foreign places we could be

I'll be flicking stones at your window

I'll be waiting outside 'til you're ready to go

Won't you come down? Come away with me

Just think of all the places we could be

I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day
