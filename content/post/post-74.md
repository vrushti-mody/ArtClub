‚ú® The colourful circles and rectangles used in this artwork, captivates the fine features of a female body.

Yes, her entire form is graceful.

Because the size of her waist has nothing to do with her beauty.

Don't you ever let someone tell you how your body should look.

Stop trying to fix your body , it was never broken.

STOP BODY SHAMING

AND GO GET YOURSELF THAT DONUT üç©
