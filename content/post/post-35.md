What was left when that fire was gone

I thought it felt right but that right was wrong

All caught up in the eye of the storm

And tryna figure out what it's like moving on

And I don't even know what kind of things I've said

My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead

So, picking up the pieces now where to begin

The hardest part of ending is starting again
