She is no princess

She needs no saving

She is a queen

She got this !

This painting celebrates all the propah ladies, who have challenged the stereotypical norms, who have broken all the barriers, who have walked through the dark times and excelled and who wont stop no matter what! It tells us about the new age female who is strong, outspoken, unafraid and unapologetically propah lady!
