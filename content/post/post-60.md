With all the chaos going on in the world, spare a moment and take a deep breath. Honey, you are a beautiful white canvas. Yes, you ! Whom society calls fat , dark , gay, unemployed, unmarried and what not . You are a beautiful canvas , You can't let these tags tear you.

Spare a moment, and love yourself.
