Hi! I had been working on a series of paintings.The series consist of four paintings based on discrete adventurous sports. These paintings have inspired me (I hope it inspires you too) to follow my passion!

# Painting 1 - Beyond Your Fear.

### Theme : THE BUCKET LIST 

☑️ Follow your dreams

The title and description of this painting are mentioned in the second picture.
For those who didn't get the hang of the description, let me put it in simple words.
'Pursuing your passion , despite the consequences, people's judgements ; requires a huge deal of courage . This painting is all about gathering that courage to choose a path not everyone follows and jump off the plane to experience every moment of your adventure! '
