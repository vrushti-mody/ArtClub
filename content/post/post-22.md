Hi! I had been working on a series of paintings.The series consist of four paintings based on discrete adventurous sports. These paintings have inspired me (I hope it inspires you too) to follow my passion!

# Painting 2 - Altered Perception

### Theme : THE BUCKET LIST 

‚òëÔ∏è Follow your dreams

Once you conquer your fear of doing the unusual, You discover a New World.
The title and description are mentioned in the second image.
In simpler words,
'When you follow your fire, your perception towards world, towards people, towards yourself changes. You stumble upon a reason to live , you find a purpose in life. Nevertheless you Believe In Yourself even if no one else does.üí™üèª EVERYDAY IS AN ADVENTURE WHEN YOU FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS!
