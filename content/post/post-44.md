One taught me love

One taught me patience

And one taught me pain

Now, I'm so amazing

Say I've loved and I've lost

But that's not what I see

So, look what I got

Look at what you taught me

And for that, I say

Thank you, next (next)

Thank you, next (next)

Thank you, next

I'm so grateful for my ex
